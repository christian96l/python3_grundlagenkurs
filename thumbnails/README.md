# Thumbnail Generator

## Problem description

*“I have a big collection of photographs, and would like to search them. I have written a up keywords for each photograph in text files, e.g. *'flower'*, *'beach'*, *'mountain'* etc. Now I need a program that can find all photographs for a given keyword.

The program should create a big picture that shows thumbnail images 100 pixels wide, like in the image below.”*

## Instructions

Implement a program according to the problem description. The following steps may be helpful:

### 1. Planning

Dissect the problem into at least three separate sub-problems. Write them down on paper (cards or a single sheet). Try to be as precise as possible. Answer resulting questions.

### 2. Divide the program into functions

Identify key functions your program needs to have. Decide what should be the input and output for each of them. Write them up as well.


### 3. Get the Graphics

The file `sample_photos.zip` contains a few example photographs. It also contains a file `pics.txt` in each subfolder. This is the input information for the program.

### 4. Explore Python libraries

You might want to take a closer look at:

* `os` for file handling
* `Pillow` for image manipulation

### 5. Write the program

After these steps, start implementing.
